## About
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

## Learning outcomes
Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about arrays, stacks, strings, and queues. You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue. You will also gain firsthand experience with the BigInteger class.
